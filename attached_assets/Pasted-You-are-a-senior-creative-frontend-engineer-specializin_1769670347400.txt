You are a senior creative frontend engineer specializing in cinematic, scroll-driven luxury websites.

Your task:
Redesign the website to EXACTLY match the animation discipline, timing, and scroll storytelling style of the attached reference video.
Do NOT create extra animations.
Do NOT add decorative motion.
Motion must be minimal, slow, and intentional.

Brand:
Luxury lab-grown diamonds.
Elegant. Calm. Ethical. Premium. Scientific.

GLOBAL RULES (MANDATORY):
- Only ONE primary animation per section
- No overlapping animations
- No infinite or looping animations
- No auto-rotating 3D objects
- Large empty space is intentional
- Motion should stop completely between sections
- If an animation is not guiding attention, REMOVE IT

Tech stack:
- Next.js (App Router)
- Tailwind CSS
- GSAP + ScrollTrigger
- Lenis (subtle settings only)
- Spline (ONLY one section)
- Framer Motion (micro-interactions only)

SCROLL MODEL (CRITICAL):
- Use GSAP pinned sections
- Each section pins for extended scroll (150%–250%)
- Animation timeline per section:
  • Fade in (0–20%)
  • Hold (20–70%)
  • Fade out (70–90%)
- No animation outside ScrollTrigger timelines

WEBSITE STRUCTURE:

1. HERO SECTION (PINNED)
- Full viewport
- Single headline
- Single subtext
- Background remains static
- Text fades in slowly and holds
- No parallax
- No background movement

2. DIAMOND REVEAL SECTION (PINNED)
- One Spline 3D diamond
- Camera fixed
- Diamond does NOT auto-rotate
- Slight mouse interaction only
- Diamond fades in from black
- Holds in silence
- Fades out

3. STORY SECTION (PINNED)
- Text-only section
- One paragraph at a time
- Text slides up slightly + opacity
- No images
- No background effects

4. AI GENERATED VISUALS SECTION (PINNED)
- Generate lab-grown diamond images (mock AI API acceptable)
- ONE image visible at a time
- Image cross-fades on scroll
- No grid
- No carousels

5. CRAFTSMANSHIP SECTION (PINNED)
- Clean layout
- Simple diagrams or text blocks
- Reveal one element per scroll phase
- No decorative motion

6. COLLECTION PREVIEW (NOT PINNED)
- Minimal product cards
- Hover = subtle scale + shadow only
- No scroll animations

7. FOOTER
- Static
- Calm fade-in only

ANIMATION GUIDELINES:
- Use only: opacity, translateY, very subtle scale
- No blur animations
- No skew
- No bouncing or elastic easing
- Use ease: power2.out or similar

LENIS SETTINGS:
- Smooth but controlled
- No floaty behavior
- Disable Lenis inside pinned sections if required

DESIGN RULES:
- Mostly white or black backgrounds
- No gradients unless extremely subtle
- One font pairing only
- Avoid visual noise
- Minimal color usage

DELIVERABLES:
- Clean, readable code
- One GSAP timeline per section
- Clear comments explaining scroll logic
- Modular components
- No experimental or unused code

IMPORTANT:
Your goal is NOT to impress with effects.
Your goal is to recreate the SAME calm, cinematic, scroll-controlled experience as the reference video.
If something feels flashy or busy, remove it.
